"""Transfer Workbench (M1.2): whole-squad evaluation of concrete transfer plans against HOLD.

Every plan the manager or the engine proposes is solved as a complete multi-gameweek plan on the
same candidate pool, validated independently against the season's rules, scored on the same
joint simulation samples as HOLD (paired gains, ADR-0007) and reported with its transfer cost
separated from its gross gain. Plan kinds:

* ``hold`` — no transfer this gameweek, optimal afterwards: the baseline, always evaluated;
* ``transfer`` — exactly the named sells and buys now (``Preferences.first_gw_exact``), optimal
  afterwards; an illegal request is rejected with the rule it breaks, never solved around;
* ``replace`` — the replacement engine's shortlist for one outgoing player (screened over every
  affordable, club-legal candidate), each evaluated as an exact single transfer;
* ``best`` — the optimiser's best plan plus distinct alternatives, optionally capped in
  first-gameweek transfers or forbidden to take hits anywhere in the plan;
* ``ladder`` (M1.7) — one rung per transfer count: the best plan with *exactly* k transfers now
  for k = 1 … ``max_transfers`` (``Preferences.first_gw_min_transfers`` with the cap), so the
  manager sees what a first, a second and a third move (free or at a hit) would each buy against
  holding, on the same samples; a rung that would need a hit is listed under ``excluded`` when
  hits are not allowed, never solved around.

Manager constraints apply to every plan of a run through ``OptimizationProblem.preferences``:
``locked`` players are kept all horizon (an exact transfer selling one is rejected) and
``banned`` players are never bought nor shortlisted.

Nothing here changes a forecast, a simulation or an optimiser constraint: the pieces are the
recommendation engine's MILP, independent validator, paired comparison and option summary.
