"""Asynchronous jobs (ADR-0009): durable job records in PostgreSQL, execution inline or via RQ.

``JobBackend.submit`` records the job (``queued``) and either executes it immediately (inline
backend: tests, single-process development) or enqueues ``fpl_api.jobs.run_job`` on Redis for
the worker. Every job kind is a plain function of (services, params) → result reference, so both
backends run the same code. Identical requests are de-duplicated by a request hash while queued
or running — but only within the kind's lease: a job whose worker died (OOM kill, container
replaced) never blocks its request forever; it is marked failed ("abandoned") and the request is
re-submitted as a new attempt. RQ's failure callback records failures RQ raises inside the work
horse (e.g. job timeouts) immediately; a SIGKILLed horse (OOM) runs no callback in RQ 2.x and
is recovered by the lease. Failed jobs are terminal and observable via
``GET /jobs/{id}``; retrying means submitting again (the scheduler does so every bucket).

Every failure is classified (``failure``): ``error`` — the job's own code raised (a bug or bad
input; the traceback is recorded) — or ``interrupted`` — the job never finished because its
process was killed, lost or timed out (OOM, container replaced, host sleep / VM clock jump).
An interrupted job wrote no result: every job publishes its outcome only at the end (database
transaction, atomic file renames), so re-submitting it is always safe.
