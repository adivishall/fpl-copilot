"""First-party product analytics for the beta (M1.1a).

Only named events from the allow-list below are stored, with a small set of allow-listed
properties (short strings, numbers, booleans). Events are keyed by the signed-in user, never by a
manager key, and never contain credentials or free text. Users can opt out (``analytics_opt_out``
on the account): their events are dropped server-side as well as not sent. The retention job
deletes events older than ``RETENTION_DAYS`` (``docs/DEPLOYMENT.md`` → *Product analytics*).
